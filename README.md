This is an adventure game developed by Graham Round for Usborne.
It was part of a book series aimed towards programming your own adventure games for the popular home-computers of its time:
  - Commodore64
  - VIC20
  - APPLE
  - TRS80
  - ELECTRON
  - 48K SPECTRUM
  - BBC

Through this repository I want to relive the magic of developing software at home in the 80's, and also to transpile this program to a more legible style in a modern language (Python)
