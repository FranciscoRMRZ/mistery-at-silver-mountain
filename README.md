# Mistery at Silver Mountain

Welcome to **Mistery at Silver Mountain**, an adventure game developed by Graham Round for Usborne. This game was originally part of a book series aimed at programming your own adventure games for popular home computers of the 1980s, including:

- Commodore 64
- VIC20
- Apple
- TRS80
- Electron
- 48K Spectrum
- BBC

This repository serves as a homage to the nostalgic era of home computing in the 80s. Through this project, I aim to relive the magic of developing software at home and bring back the essence of classic adventure gaming.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to transpile the original game written in its respective 1980s programming language into a more modern and readable style using Python. By doing so, we aim to preserve the essence and gameplay mechanics of the original game while making it accessible to a wider audience.


## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Graham Round and Usborne for creating the original **Mistery at Silver Mountain** game and inspiring generations of programmers and gamers alike.

Let's embark on this nostalgic journey together and relive the magic of classic adventure gaming! üéÆüèîÔ∏è
